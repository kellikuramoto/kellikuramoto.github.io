              During Summer 2022, I had the opportunity to collaborate with two fellow UX design interns on a project aimed at aligning the CoStar Properties product with the newly introduced Cosmos design system. I undertook the task of redesigning specific tabs within the product to enhance their ability to address user needs effectively.

          <p class="component-text component-header">Meet with Internal CoStar employees to better understand the projected use of the product</p>
          <p class="component-text">
            Due to time and other constraints I was unable to talk with customers directly. Instead, I talked to the next best people, CoStar employees who were client facing, such as Project Managers and Sales Associates. 
          </p>
          <ul>
          For each of my assigned pages, I scheduled meetings with employees who could answer my 3 basic questions:
            <li>What is the purpose of this page?</li>
            <li>Who uses this page?</li>
            <li>What changes do you want to be made?</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="component-text">
            For this case study, I am going to specifically focus on the Peers page.
          </p>

        <div class="casestudy-component">
          <h2><span class="h2-unbold">⦿</span> Gathering my insights</h2>
          <p class="component-text component-header">No customization or comparability function on Peers page</p>
          <p class="component-text">
            After speaking with the previous project manager of the Peer page, I was able to gauge that the purpose of the Peers page was to allow users to compare their property against similar “peers” properties
          </p>             
          <ul>
            The biggest areas of improvement were:
            <li>Visual disconnect between Map and List View</li>
            <li>Limited comparison functionality</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="component-text">
            I saw an opportunity to increase the user value of this page 10 fold because comparison is a huge advantage within the commercial real estate industry. My goal for this redesign was to <span class="costar-bold-color"> increase the ability of the user to quickly customize their peer set, as well as compare their property among chosen metrics.</span>
          </p>      
        </div>

        <div class="casestudy-component">
          <h2><span class="h2-unbold">⦿</span> Multiple design directions</h2>
          <p class="component-text component-header">Utilizing the Proximity Principle to increase feedback</p>

          <p class="component-text">
            I noticed right away that the table and map view were extremely far apart which made it hard for users to connect them mentally, and as a response made it impossible to visualize their changes to the peer set.
          </p>

            <img src="images/costar-lofi.png" class="img-center full-size" id="costar-lofi" alt="CoStar Case Study">
          </div>

          <p class="component-right">
            As you can see, there was limited vertical space on the page due to width of the map and columns. After a design review with my manager and a group of senior designers, I went back to the drawing board and rethink how to strengthen this visual connection. 
          </p>     
        </div>

        <div class="casestudy-component">
          <h2><span class="h2-unbold">⦿</span> Switching to focus on comparability</h2>
          <p class="component-text component-header">Increasing value add by increasing user options</p>
          
          <p class="component-text">
            Somewhat stuck, I decided to take a step back from trying to tackle customization and move towards working on comparability. I designed a Compare By drop down that would allow users to select a metric.   
          </p>         
          <img src="images/costar-comparability.png" class="img-center" alt="CoStar Case Study">
          <p class="component-text">
            During my second round of feedback, my managers pointed out that the Compare By functionality already existed within the product. However, it was instead referred to as the Sort button. <br>
            Immediately I saw the benefits of leverage existing functionality. While fleshing out this idea, inspiration struck!

          <h2><span class="h2-unbold">⦿</span> Leveraging current functionality of product</h2>
          <p class="component-text component-header">Adding toggle feature of list and map view</p>
          <p class="component-text">
            Instead of visually trying to create a new connection between the table and map view, I could leverage an existing feature of the product to achieve this goal. On the properties home page, there is a toggle feature that allows users to switch between map and list view. This feature would remove all the obstacles in my previous designs, namely too little vertical visual space.
