          <h5>Travelers spend upwards of 30% of their time making sense of the web</h5>
          <p>
            There are a variety of factors that one must consider when planning a trip which can become increasingly overwhelming. My team and I wanted to answer one simple question: <br>
            How can we help people make great, evidence-based decisions about where to go and what to do on a trip?
          </p>
        </div>

            <ul>
              <li>Travelers can rely on activities, housing,  transportation with worry</li>
              <li>Reduces need to search third party apps such as TripAdvisor or google</li>

        <div class="casestudy-component">
          <h4 class="bold">Preliminary research</h4>
          <h5>Surveying users allowed us to narrow down scope of problem space</h5>
          <p>
            Due to the large problem space of trip planning, we conducted a survey to narrow down our scope and address the biggest needs of our users. 
          </p>
          <ul>
            Our survey shows that the two biggest obstacles while trip planning were
            <li>Indecisiveness and activities</li>
            <li>Trustworthiness of online information</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="casestudy-component">
          <h4 class="bold">Defining our problem statement</h4>
          <h5>Reverse assumptions allowed us to challenge the status quo of the current trip planning space</h5>
          <p>
            To start populating ideas for our problem statement we wanted to push the boundaries on how we normally approach trip planning. After grouping them into common themes, we found that our key takeaways were:
          <ul>
            <li>Method of cost-saving during travel is utilizing public transportation</li>
            <li>Trip planning does not have to be planned out beforehand, spontaneity can result in some good memories</li>
          </ul>
          We were able to narrow our project scope to a how might we statement:
          How might we utilize public/ share resources while planning trips?          
        </p>      
        </div>

        <div class="casestudy-component">
          <h4 class="bold">Conducting a contextual inquiry</h4>
          <h5>Talking to users verified assumptions and created opportunities</h5>
          <p>
            After narrowing the problem space, we dove deeper with a contextual research method: Directed Storytelling. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In order to analyze our findings, we each created interpretation notes and use those as the foundation for our affinity diagram. Our affinity diagram helped us zoom out and see larger themes present in our problem space. We decided to model our findings in the form of an Empathy map and Customer Journey map.

        <div class="casestudy-component">
          <h4 class="bold">Gathering our insights</h4>
          <h5>Transformed what our users said into general insights</h5>
          <p>
            After taking a step back and looking at all of the research we had gathered and our models, our biggest insights were:
            <ul>
              <li>People prefer to use public transportation if city planning is robust and has good coverage</li>
              <li>When people realize public transportation stops align with their itinerary, they are more likely to use public transit</li>
              <li>People who stay near public transportation stops can leverage the transportation network to plan their trip </li>
              <li>If people perceive public transportation as the best mode, they will feel more independent while using it</li>
              <li>In cities where public transportation apps are comparable to private ride sharing apps, people feel more confident in the transportation and are more willing to use it</li>
            </ul>
          </p>     
        </div>

        <div class="casestudy-component">
          <h4 class="bold">Investigating user needs</h4>
          <h5>Story boarding allowed us to understand how to address user wants and needs</h5>
          <p>
            We translated our insights from our contextual inquiry into user wants and needs. These would become the foundations of our storyboards. 
            <ul>
              User Needs
              <li>Need technology to cluster activities based off public</li>
              <li>Need technology to help understand and use public transportation</li>
              <li>Want to stay near public transportation in order to utilize</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/dailydetour-sketches.png" class="img-center" alt="CoStar Case Study">
          </p>     
        </div>

        <div class="casestudy-component">
          <h4 class="bold">Prototyping our ideas</h4>
          <h5>Created a mobile application that addressed user needs identified in storyboard</h5>
          <p>
            After a couple rounds of speed dating with our storyboards, we found that:
          <ul>
              <li>Online community forums serve as a trustworthy sources of activities</li>
              <li>Detours were welcomed if users did not have a reservation or time constraints</li>
              <li>Proximity and cost were large factors when deciding on transportation</li>
              <li>Detailed information about trip is necessary when using public transportation</li>
            </ul>
            Once we had a clear idea of the user needs and how to address them, I started to design a mobile application that highlighted features such as a community forum, itinerary with detours, as well as detailed information about transportation routes.
