            <h2><span class="h2-unbold">⦿</span> Overview</h2>
            <p>
              As part of my Human-Computer Interaction studio class, our assignment was to design a conversational agent for our giving domain: hospitality. My primary responsibility was leading the ideation process for the agent and carefully considering the user experience throughout the design.

          <h2><span class="h2-unbold">⦿</span> Narrowing our domain</h2>
          <p class="component-text component-header">Conducted secondary research within 4 subdomains of hospitality to identify the ideal ecosystem for our problem</p>
          <p class="component-text">
            We conducted research in 4 subdomains: (1) Restaurants (2) Hotels (3) Resorts (4) Concerts      

            <img src="images/cui-domain.png" class="img-center full-size" alt="Conversational Agent Case Study">
            We decided to narrow our scope down to the hotel industry, because we identified a problem that we felt could be solved by the characteristics of a conversational agent: <span class="bold">87% of hotels experience staffing shortages, leading to increase strain and decreased service</span>. This lead us to our overarching question:
            <br>
            <span class="cui-bold-color">How do we give hotel guests an elevated experience without increasing work load for employees?</span>
          </p>

          <h2><span class="h2-unbold">⦿</span> Leveraging the strengths of a conversational agent</h2>

          <p class="component-text component-header">Conversational agents can streamline requests and leverage conversational principles to nudge guests
          </p>

          <p class="component-text">
            Once we understood the journey of our target user: a hotel guest and how they interact with other staff members. We identified areas of automation along the customer journey to serve as prompts for our conversational agent: Archie.  

            <img src="images/cui-journey.png" class="img-center full-size" alt="Conversational Agent Case Study">

            We also saw a clear opportunity to push the bounds of our conversational agent further by leveraging the characteristics of conversation to nudge guests by: 
            <ul>
              <li>
                offering reminders
              </li>
              <li>
                anticipating needs
              </li>
              <li>
                providing suggestions
              </li>
            </ul>

            An example of this is:

        <div class="casestudy-component">
          <h2><span class="h2-unbold">⦿</span> Keeping the user in control</h2>

          <p class="component-text component-header">Created a “key lock” system to address the issue of privacy and keep the user in control </p>

          <p class="component-text">
            We had to very carefully consider when and how our CUI would interface with a guest, especially with the premonition that conversational agents are always listening (think Alexa). 
            <br>
            We went ideated through an entire spectrum of solutions and finally landed on an artifact “unlocking” Archie. We decided to use the hotel keycard itself as a key to Archie. 
            <br>
            Inserting a key card to enable power is a familiar action in the context of a hotel room. Additionally, by incorporating this physical toggle, we gave the users a sense of control, without the addition of more artifacts.

        <div class="casestudy-component">
          <h2><span class="h2-unbold">⦿</span> Bringing Archie alive</h2>

          <p class="component-text component-header">Incorporating humor as a mechanism to humanize our conversational agent and increase the comfortability for the user</p>

          <p class="component-text">
            One of the biggest pieces of critique that our group received was the fact that our conversational agent seemed “too robotic”. We brainstormed different ways to humanize our agent and landed on leveraging humor as a technique. An example of this is:
