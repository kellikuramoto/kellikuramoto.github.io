              One of Amazon Music’s goals for 2023 is to help support Artists by providing them with different monetization strategies. In response, the Product Design Team at Amazon Music conducted a Design Sprint to generate ideas around the topic of Artist Monetization. “Next generation box sets”, known as Fan Bundles, gained the highest confidence with regards to addressing customer needs.

          </div>
          <p class="component-text">I attacked the problem of Artist monetization from both sides of the customer experience: Artist and Fan. Balancing the needs of both customers was certainly a challenge throughout the entire summer. <span class="amazon-bold-color">However, it was clear that both fans and artists wanted connection with each other (in one way or another).</span></p>

          <p class="component-text">
            Just like how dedicated fans form the bedrock of an artist's financial stability by making consistent purchases, our "super fans" serve as the core customers who actively seek more engagement and exclusive content. Centering the feature of “fan bundles” around super fan’s needs benefits both of our customers.

              Based on behaviors observed during card sort, I created super fan archetypes that highlights nuances between different types of fans            
            </p>
            <p class="component-text">
              While we had clearly outlined our target customer as “super fans”, I saw behaviors and observation patterns emerge as I parsed research results. Personifying these differences helped us address super fans individual needs better with curated bundles for these specific archetypes.

            <h2><span class="h2-unbold">⦿</span> Product Bundle Recommendations</h2>
            <p class="component-text component-header">
              Synthesizing both the competitive analysis and research insights, I created 4 different fan bundle recommendations that target at least one type of super fan            
            </p>

            </p>

            <p class="component-text">
              All of the recommended bundles contain physical merch, as from the research, this was the most highly request item from both Artists and Fans. Additionally, all of the items in the recommended bundles received over 50% agreement from our customers. Using data to drive the creation of these fan bundles allowed me to present my findings with the highest confidence to relevant stakeholders and other designers.
